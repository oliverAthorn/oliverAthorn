# Hello and welcome! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm @oliverAthorn, at 28 I decided to quit my career and throw myself entirely into programming

Shortly after, I was picked up by Jet2Holidays: taught about .NET, learned C#, SQL, Blazor, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, KAFKA, Docker (etc! ♾️)

This time has been the happiest in my life. I do not regret waiting to get into programming, but I am exceedingly happy I have found it now.
